### Note to self
- we are following the neetcode roadmap 
- dude, command option for multiline bro
- longest consecutive sequence showcases on how to use set to find elements in an array
    - essentially, casting the nums input into an array
    - now, we can start looking for values within that set in O(1)

### 3 Feb
- 3sum - I was getting the wrong answer because I had the return statement INSIDE the for loop
- 


METHOD TO THE MADNESS
- PLAN THE PROBLEMS so we make sure we get it done during that day or time
- HAVE THE TIMER READY
- Go through the problem
- SUMMARIZE - this is important because sometimes I thought I understood the problem but I really did not
- PLAN THE APPROACH
- Go through the problem - 10 minutes at the most
- test the test cases in remarkable
- OPTIONAL: practice print statements to see how can I effectively debug the problem with the help of Gemini
- Optimize
- Determine Time and Space Complexity
- Create a running list of python functions, tips and tricks so we can just refer to one document - this will likely be a separate tab
