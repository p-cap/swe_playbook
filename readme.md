# METHOD TO THE MADNESS
- PLAN THE PROBLEMS so we make sure we get it done during that day or time
- HAVE THE TIMER READY
- Go through the problem
- SUMMARIZE - this is important because sometimes I thought I understood the problem but I really did not
- PLAN THE APPROACH
- Go through the problem - 10 minutes at the most
- test the test cases in remarkable
- OPTIONAL: practice print statements to see how can I effectively debug the problem with the help of Gemini
- Optimize
- Determine Time and Space Complexity
- Create a running list of python functions, tips and tricks so we can just refer to one document - this will likely be a separate tab
